## Layered PDF

LayereredPDF is i useful extention for [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org)

With the LayeredPDF extension, it is possible to create PDF documents with layers from within Inkscape. All layers from Inkscape are transferred 1:1 to the PDF.
To use these features, the PyMuPDF module must be installed.

I've tested it on Fedora Linux. It should work on Windows, too. Unfortunately on Windows I got an ModuleNotFound-Error, even PyMuPDF was correct installed.
